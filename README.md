# jobboard
This is a simple job board website that shows main functionality of a job searching site. It includes listing jobs, details about them, sort jobs via keywords and many more. I did this in my university project. This site was buit using HTML and CSS,JavaScript. I also provided some mock data for the site. This data can be rearragned/add/subtract as per user wish.
